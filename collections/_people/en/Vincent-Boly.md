His research focuses on innovation processes. One of the major aspects concerns the metrology of innovation both in its theoretical and technological dimension (development of evaluation software). Thus the approaches developed allow companies to measure their capacity to innovate and are in line with new international standards. The second part concerns the management of the upstream stages of innovative projects. The work focuses on the development of theoretical models and methodologies in the areas of needs analysis, value chain approaches, customer/supplier co-innovation, the digital chain for formulated products.
