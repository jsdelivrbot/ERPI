## Innovation for Health and Wellness!

What are we doing about health?

Objective evaluation of the technical skills of surgeons.
Support for surgeons in the self-assessment of their "technical performance" through the use of physiological sensors (e.g. GSR, eye-tracking, ECG).

## Creation of "dry-models" for the training and certification of surgeons.
We use 3D printing technologies to manufacture surgical training models to reduce the use of animals and human organs. The creation of specific cases and models facilitates the "standards" for all learners during their evaluation. In addition, in line with the "Green-Fablab" approach, the models designed and used can be recycled to make new ones and be part of a virtuous cycle.
